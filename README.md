# letratiempo-ltt
This is a website for the company "Letra Tiempo" with html5 and responsive desing, CSS, JS, PHP.
A text-heavy, article-oriented design built around a huge background image (with a new parallax implementation I'm testing) and scroll effects (powered by Scrollex). A *slight* departure from all the one-pagers I've been doing lately, but one that fulfills a few user requests and makes use of some new techniques I've been wanting to try out. Enjoy it :)
